# C++ Study Repository
This repository contains my journey of learning and practicing C++.  
It includes basic syntax, data structures, algorithms, OOP concepts, and small projects.




## Goals
- Learn C++ basic syntax and structure.
- Understand pointers, references, and memory management.
- Implement OOP: class, inheritance, polymorphism.
